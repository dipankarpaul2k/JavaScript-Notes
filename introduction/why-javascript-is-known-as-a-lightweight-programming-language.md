# Why JavaScript is known as a lightweight programming language?

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for creating web applications. It is often referred to as the "language of the web" as it is the most widely used programming language for web development. JavaScript runs on the client side, meaning it is executed by the web browser on the user's device.

## Why is JavaScript lightweight?
JavaScript is known as a lightweight programming language for several reasons:

### 1. Interpreted Language:
JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning it does not require compilation before execution. This makes it lightweight compared to compiled languages like Java or C++, which need to be compiled into executable code.

### 2. Single-threaded and Event-driven:
JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it can only execute one piece of code at a time. This simplicity contributes to its lightweight nature, as it does not require complex multithreading management. Additionally, JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it responds to user actions or events rather than running continuously in the background. This event-driven approach keeps the language lightweight by only executing code when necessary.

### 3. Minimal Syntax and Features:
JavaScript has a minimalistic syntax compared to other programming languages. It does not include features such as pointers or complex memory management, which can add complexity and overhead to a language. The simplicity of JavaScript's syntax and feature set contributes to its lightweight nature.

### 4. Platform-independent:
JavaScript is a platform-independent language, meaning it can run on any device or operating system without the need for specific adaptations or modifications. This platform independence makes JavaScript highly portable and lightweight.

### 5. Small Footprint:
JavaScript has a small file size, which makes it load quickly and consume less system resources. This is especially important for web applications, as it allows them to run smoothly and efficiently on low-powered devices or in situations with limited bandwidth.

Overall, JavaScript is known as a lightweight programming language due to its interpreted nature, single-threaded and event-driven approach, minimal syntax and features, platform independence, and small footprint.

## Example: 

```javascript
//This is a simple JavaScript function that adds two numbers
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
console.log(addNumbers(5, 10));  //Output: 15
```
