# Where is Javascript used?

## Introduction
JavaScript is a programming language that is used for creating websites and web-based applications. It is a lightweight language that is easy to learn and use. JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, and it can be used in various contexts such as front-end development, server-side programming, and database development.

## Front-end Development
JavaScript is primarily used for front-end development. It is the language that powers the interactivity of websites. It can be used to create dynamic user interfaces, add interactivity to static content, and create animations and effects. JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue are widely used for building complex web applications.

For example, consider the Google Maps application. The Google Maps interface is built using JavaScript. The JavaScript code allows users to interact with the map, add markers, and get directions.

## Back-end Development
JavaScript can also be used for back-end development. Node.js is a popular platform that enables the use of JavaScript on the server-side. Node.js provides a runtime environment for building web applications using JavaScript. It includes a comprehensive set of modules that simplify the development of server-side applications.

For example, consider the LinkedIn application. The LinkedIn back-end is built using Node.js. The Node.js code interacts with the database, processes requests, and generates responses.

## Database Development
JavaScript can also be used for database development. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses JavaScript as its query language. MongoDB provides a simple and flexible approach to database design and management, and it enables easy integration with other JavaScript technologies.

For example, consider the Trello application. The Trello database is built using MongoDB. The JavaScript code interacts with the MongoDB database, retrieves data, and updates documents.

## Games
Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well.

It provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.
