Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Dipankar Paul, aspiring Full Stack Developer with a passion for learning new technologies.

Currently, I am learning my front-end development and full-stack development through Apna College Delta. With a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly applications, I am excited to continue my journey in the tech industry.

In this series I will be sharing my journey in learning Javascript and posting my own notes from the process. These notes can be helpful for beginners in learning this amazing language.
